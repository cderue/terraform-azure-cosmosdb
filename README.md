# Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Cosmos DB

The Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Cosmos DB simplifies the deployment and management of globally distributed, multi-model databases on Azure without requiring Terraform expertise. This module provides a configuration-driven approach to provisioning high-performance, scalable, and secure NoSQL and relational databases.

## Key features:
- No-code deployment – Easily configure and deploy Cosmos DB instances without writing Terraform scripts.
- Multi-model support – Supports multiple data models, including SQL (Core), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin (Graph), and Table APIs.
- Global distribution – Automatically replicate data across multiple Azure regions for low-latency access.
- Security & compliance – Implements encryption, private endpoints, role-based access control (RBAC), and firewall rules.
- Automatic scaling – Supports autoscaling throughput to optimize performance and cost.

## Use cases:
- Deploying highly available and globally distributed NoSQL databases for web, mobile, and IoT applications.
- Running mission-critical applications requiring low-latency, high-performance data storage.
- Automating database provisioning for DevOps teams and cloud-native applications.
